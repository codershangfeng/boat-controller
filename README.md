## Basic Idea

Demo for defining custom resouces in kubernetes.

Referring to official doc - [Extending Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/)

There could be 2 options:

1. CRDs
1. API Aggregation

As official claimed:
>Aggregated APIs are subordinate API servers that sit behind the primary API server, which acts as a proxy. This arrangement is called API Aggregation (AA). To users, the Kubernetes API appears extended.

>CRDs allow users to create new types of resources without adding another API server. You do not need to understand API Aggregation to use CRDs.

Each of them should shows its flexibility and robus at some level.

In this demo project, we will try to explore both of them.

## How to curl Local Docker Kubernetes api-server

The mTLS is enabled on Kubernetes api-server.
There are **2** certificate and **1** key file needed:

1. CA certificate belonging to the CA that signed the serverâ€™s certificate
1. Client certificate
1. Client private key

We could find these information in the `${HOME}/.kube/config`, in which these information are encoded with Base64.

For example, 

1. CA cert -> `.clusters[0].cluster.certificate-authority-data`
1. Client cert -> `.users[0].user.client-certificate-data`
1. Client private key -> `.users[0].user.client-key-data`

You can use `yq` and `base64` to decode it, i.e.:
```bash
yq e '.users[0].user.client-certificate-data' ~/.kube/config | base64 -d > client.crt
```

After then, you can send watch request to the target kubernetes api-server by:
```bash
curl -i --cacert ca.crt --key client.key --cert client.crt https://localhost:6443/api/v1/watch/pods\?watch\=yes
```
With response:
```bash
HTTP/2 200
cache-control: no-cache, private
content-type: application/json
